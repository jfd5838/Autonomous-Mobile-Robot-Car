# Autonomous Mobile Robot Car
Our project tasked us with programming and applying a robot car that would autonomously move around a track without user input.

# Instructions for Use
Place the robot car down on the track, pointed across the long straight line, and then switch the battery pack to ON. The car will autonomously move along the track using it's camera and infrared sensors to identify what is and isn't the track, as well as read road signs that will initiate commands that will change the way the car performs.
