00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:16.889
Jonathan Cunningham: Hi! This is Jonathan Cunningham doing a demo for my team and our autonomous sign detecting robot. You can see, I have the camera on over here. It's a little laggy, but

2
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:40.859
Jonathan Cunningham: I am just jump into everything I can show. I have gotten a few, very few perfect runs with this robot. I will say that stop signs it detects the best. Then yield. Signs are second, then speed limit. Signs are 3rd but I'll get into that a little bit and maybe dive into the code. But 1st let's do a run through and see if it can follow this track and stop with the stop sign like it's supposed to.

3
00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.529
Jonathan Cunningham: I'm gonna reach over and turn on the power, for the Arduino

4
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.720
Jonathan Cunningham: don't seem to get stuck in coronary sometimes.

5
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.240
Jonathan Cunningham: Oh, they're registered to stop.

6
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:02.920
Jonathan Cunningham: Well, let's try another one.

7
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:05.510
Jonathan Cunningham: There we go.

8
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:13.380
Jonathan Cunningham: So on the right side of the screen you're seeing a log from

9
00:01:21.443 --> 00:01:43.340
Jonathan Cunningham: on the right side of the screen. You're seeing a log of what's getting sent to the Arduino, and how it's communicating with the pie. You can see that since. Stop, and then it sent go. I do want to run that one more time to see if I can get a little cleaner. But you can see all these logs of it sending for different multiple different signs and what it does to the Arduino when it registers, I'll

10
00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.530
Jonathan Cunningham: I can actually show you in the code real quick.

11
00:01:50.497 --> 00:01:55.280
Jonathan Cunningham: Also, by the way, we're using flask for our camera streaming purposes.

12
00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:05.849
Jonathan Cunningham: And on top of that for sign detection. We're using hard cascade files stop sign. One was trained the best. The other 2 are a little finicky.

13
00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.400
Jonathan Cunningham: But in fact, I do want to show

14
00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:22.136
Jonathan Cunningham: specifically the speed limit. Signs also make use of OS. Ocr. For a text recognition, so it can tell which number is looking at

15
00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:43.820
Jonathan Cunningham: It's about it for this portion of the code. But as you saw this is, can this runs one startup of the pi you can run it through the terminal, and it can give you messages of everything that's going on between the Pi and the Arduino. Excuse the low voltage warning. I always get that with this battery pack. But

16
00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.989
Jonathan Cunningham: try to run that one more time

17
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.250
Jonathan Cunningham: again. Some of this is just hardware issues.

18
00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.720
Jonathan Cunningham: I've had the wheels fall off on multiple times. But

19
00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:03.559
Jonathan Cunningham: let's see if we can get a better run, not sharing the same way.

20
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.320
Jonathan Cunningham: There we go, you know, Patchy that time.

21
00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:12.430
Jonathan Cunningham: What's that?

22
00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.350
Jonathan Cunningham: But I think you get the idea the stop sign. At least

23
00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:35.080
Jonathan Cunningham: I would like to show the other signs. I do have them printed out. On these little stands, as you can see, it should actually be able to register on the camera.

24
00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:38.870
Jonathan Cunningham: You

25
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:54.439
Jonathan Cunningham: also, you can't see from this view, but the robot does light up, depending on which sign it's looking at as an indicator of what it messages receiving, and also see on the right that it got yield, and then it got sped up after a certain amount of time after the yield was off screen.

26
00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.099
Jonathan Cunningham: You can also see

27
00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.189
Jonathan Cunningham: speed limit, fire a little bit.

28
00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.390
Jonathan Cunningham: It ignores when it can't register what number it is.

29
00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:22.900
Jonathan Cunningham: because sometimes they'll register numbers that aren't possible for a speed limit or aren't legal for a speed limit.

30
00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:30.660
Jonathan Cunningham: also comes down to lighting and and positioning for these lesser trained models. Unfortunately.

31
00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.350
Jonathan Cunningham: Oh, here we go.

32
00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:38.749
Jonathan Cunningham: I read that as a 15, but you get the idea that it, when it does register something.

33
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:49.560
Jonathan Cunningham: sends the correct one to the Arduino, and then it will ignore it. If it's a duplicate, or if it's a number that's not feasible for a speed limit.

34
00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.610
Jonathan Cunningham: Just speaking on that a little bit also. Oh, there we go, 25 in it, little Blue.

35
00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:26.840
Jonathan Cunningham: I would like to show some of the Arduino code as well. Unfortunately, again, hardware kind of held us back a little bit, and having this run as smoothly as possible, especially in terms of line tracking. It tracks the line pretty well. I've had the wheels fall off of me multiple times like I said when trying to make turns or you get stuck at a turn that stop sign was maybe in a bad position because of stopping at the turn and losing momentum. But

36
00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.349
Jonathan Cunningham: just to look at the code

37
00:05:33.071 --> 00:06:01.020
Jonathan Cunningham: anywhere where it says serial available is sending a message, or it's getting receiving a message from the pie. Specifically, this block, right here is a lot of the logic for the sign handling the signs. So, as you saw earlier. It received stop, and then it lit up red and it stopped and then it received the command, Go after a little bit, and then reset everything, yield, just slows the car down, and then speeds it back up to whatever degree it was.

38
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:09.670
Jonathan Cunningham: and then also change speed, which takes in whichever integer at the end of change speed the change speed command was from the pod

39
00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:14.909
Jonathan Cunningham: again. All this logic

40
00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:24.659
Jonathan Cunningham: works pretty well. It's just hardware issues. Camera. That is not perfect, but something do. In fact, I would like to see if this

41
00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:27.769
Jonathan Cunningham: shows a little clearer.

42
00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:33.889
Jonathan Cunningham: I've had a little better luck with a phone because it's backlit, and it can detect it a little

43
00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:38.530
Jonathan Cunningham: more, you know. Expect it a little more consistently.

44
00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:44.670
Jonathan Cunningham: You can see that at least sees that it's there and reading unclear.

45
00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:48.209
Jonathan Cunningham: you can get a number on it.

46
00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.970
Jonathan Cunningham: No, it doesn't look like it's gonna give us a number.

47
00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:05.531
Jonathan Cunningham: Well, you saw a little earlier that I sent 25 to the

48
00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:15.779
Jonathan Cunningham: yeah, right here. Oh, actually, you know what it was reading 2025. It's just already changed the speed to 25. So it ignores duplicates like I said earlier. So

49
00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:19.170
Jonathan Cunningham: that's basically the gist of all of

50
00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:23.483
Jonathan Cunningham: the functionality for this robot. The line tracking you saw

51
00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:37.521
Jonathan Cunningham: and all the signs that we have, you can always add more signs more cascade files train better ones for yield and speed limit to have it run smoother.

52
00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:47.915
Jonathan Cunningham: but yeah, that's about it other than some 3 printed parts for the camera and the pie case and hooking up the battery which you'll see in

53
00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:59.499
Jonathan Cunningham: some other angles, because I can't catch that with just this recording the screen. But that's about it for our project, and we hope to demo live and have it a little smoother by then. Thank you.
